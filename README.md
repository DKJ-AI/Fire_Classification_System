# deforestation-detector
> The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify fire-induced deforestation events by analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. The model will identify and categorize wildfire occurrences, enabling better monitoring and management of fire-related events across different regions.

Since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 460.1 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS. So, I am adding the link here in the readme file.
